# Requirements : 
1)Integration with Smart Contracts: Modify your existing smart contracts or develop new ones to integrate the Request Network functionalities. This may involve implementing payment request creation, payment verification, and handling repayment events.

2)Implementation of Request Network Libraries: Utilize Request Network libraries or APIs to interact with the protocol and perform operations such as creating payment requests, verifying payments, and handling repayment events. These libraries provide convenient abstractions and utilities for interacting with the Request Network.

3)User Interface Enhancements: Update your user interface to support the creation and management of payment requests using the Request Network. This may involve integrating Request Network widgets, implementing custom UI components, or designing a seamless user experience for requesting and making payments.

4)Deploy on Gnosis testnet
